# Algorithm Project
## leetcode problem solving project 

### About 
This project is a collection of solutions to various LeetCode problems. The goal was to better understand sorting and Network delay time algorithms.
To resolve the sort array problem, I used a count sort algorithm written in Javascript. This resulted in two pasted cases. The test arrays were [5,2,3,1] and [5,1,1,2,0,0], and the final run time was 187ms. The Count sort algorithm has a time complexity of and a space complexity of.
To resolve the network delay time problem, I chose to work with the Dijkstra algorithm. To be consistent with the editorial that I used to learn how to solve the problem, I used Java as the coding language. To solve this problem, I had to first apply the Dijkstra algorithm before applying the network delay time algorithm. This resulted in passing three cases, in which the final run time was 28ms.
